# My First React Project: Pokédex for Learning and Exploration

This marks my inaugural project crafted with React, an endeavor driven by a pursuit of knowledge and skill acquisition within this remarkable technology. Throughout this venture, I delved into fundamental concepts, such as React-Router and React-Json-Server, employing practices like hooks, and more.
The Pokédex I developed offers a comprehensive view of Pokémon, enabling users to peruse the complete list, delve into specific Pokémon details, and apply filters based on name, type, or ID.

## Inspired by the Pokémon Portal:

Drawing inspiration from the website https://sg.portal-pokemon.com/play/pokedex, I incorporated elements and images from this source. The resulting design pays homage to this reference, infused with my personal touch.

##Project Execution:

To explore the project, one must download dependencies using NPM and execute the appropriate commands to launch the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install` (To download the dependences of the project)
### `npm run server` (To broadcast the fake api of pokemons)
### `npm start` (To start the App)
